predicting west nile virus in Chicago


This is project #4 for the GA data science immersive course, focusing on predicting the presence of West Nile Virus in mosquito traps in Chicago. The purpose of this project was to practice synthesizing multiple different skills in order to solve a problem in small teams (4), as well as familiarizing ourselves with GitHub and version control.


Since this is a group project, a lot of code and analysis is shared effort, though most of my personal work can be found in the "Brian" folder.


Prompt: "Due to the recent epidemic of West Nile Virus in the Windy City, we've had the Department of Public Health set up a surveillance and control system. We're hoping it will let us learn something from the mosquito population as we collect data over time. Pesticides are a necessary evil in the fight for public health and safety, not to mention expensive! We need to derive an effective plan to deploy pesticides throughout the city, and that is exactly where you come in!"
